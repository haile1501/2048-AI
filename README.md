# Introduction to AI Group 1 capstone project
  Game theory is a branch of mathematics used for typical strategic interaction be-
tween different players (agents). Game theory has been a large field of Artificial In-
telligence, an exciting subject to study and easy to present. In our project, we are trying to
solve the 2048 game – a stochastic and partially observable environment by applying
several algorithms such as minimax alpha beta pruning, expectimax and Monte Carlo
tree search (MCTS) algorithms.
